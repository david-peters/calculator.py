which at the moment it will allow two numbers to be added/subtracted/divided/ multiplid together and also allow to have a number to have a power of a number (for example 5 to the power of 8)

after testing to see that if the power function worked (which it did) two new functions were added to the program, having a number with a power then proceeds to multiply by a different one, following by something similar but instead of multiplying a number, it is divisable by one
